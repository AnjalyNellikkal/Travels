            <h5 class="card-title">RAJASTHAN</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Often when asked to visualize the kingdom of Rajputs, images of rusty red forts, flamboyant village markets, men and women whirling in their traditional dresses may come flashing on our mind. However, this place is not confined to just that. Take a deeper look into the wildlife of Rajasthan where the animals play free in their many Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks. The immense beauty of spotting wild animals out in the open is only done best by taking jungle safaris and trust us, Rajasthan couldn’t be more fascinating place to start. </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">JAMMU AND KASHMIR</h5>
            <p class="card-text">A popular hill station in India, Gulmarg is a must-visit place in Jammu and Kashmir. In the local language, the name Gulmarg means ‘meadows of flowers’ and it truly means what it says. The place was previously known as ‘Gaurimarg’ which means ‘the path of Devi Gauri.’ It was renamed Gulmarg by Yousuf Shah Chak, the last ruler of the Chak dynasty, who ruled from 1579 to 1586 AD. It is one of the favourite places of Yousuf Shah Chak as he married his wife Habba Khatoon here, who was also a poetess from Gulmarg.</p>
